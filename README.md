### App Idea Evaluation

- Story: For those who have trouble calculating how much each person needs to pay by hand, the app simply does all complex calculations for you. The app promotes productivity when it comes to keeping track and completing any payments you owe to others.
- Market: Groups who generally go out to restaurants to eat.
- Habit: People use this when in restaurants.
- Scope:  V1 would allow users to directly input the cost of each item and the number of people who are paying. V2 would allow users to take a pitcure of the receipt. The app would scan the receipt for prices and split amongst people evenly. V3 would allow different options of payment. V4 would allow users to connect to their Venmo account.
